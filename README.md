# Questions & Answers

Q: What is PoGo?

A: PoGo is an UWP (Universal Windows Platform) client for Niantic's Pokemonâ„¢ Go Android/iOS game. Being a client, this means that it gives you the ability to play in the same game-world as your friends that are playing with an Android or iOS device.

Q: Why PoGo?

A: Because learning new things is always cool. Because it could be done. Because Microsoft rejected my job application saying that I wasn't showing enough "passion", and this proves them wrong :)

Q: Will this app feature 3D graphics and AR?

A: No, for both of them, it just takes too much work. If you feel that you could do this, clone the repo, add the changes and submit a pull request.

Q: Will this work on Windows Phone 8.1?

A: Not officialy. This is an open-source project, so people might fork it and port it to Windows Phone 8.1 later on.

Q: Can I play with the same account that I'm using on my Android/iOS device?

A: Yes, but **not at the same time or you may end up having a duplicated account** so, please, logout from the Android app before logging in PoGo.

Q: Will it run on low-end devices?

A: Yes, but the performance may not be perfect.

Q: Why is the Device portal returning error 0x80073cf6?

A: Change storage settings from SD card to phone storage. More infos [here](github.com/ST-Apps/PoGo-UWP/issues/11)
If you already had the app installed, probably a reboot is required.

Q: How can I logout?

A: Press the Pokeball and hit the "LOGOUT" button in the top right corner.
